#El Picador

This is a simple dark Atom theme.  

It uses a small palette of contrasting colours for simplicity:

 - red: #e24c38
 - orange: #e28438
 - (very light) yellow: #eff0a9
 - green: #40a977
 - blue: #49c9eb

It has a dark background and uses a number of shades of grey for emphasis.

The different syntax types used in Atom have been set as variables (e.g.
storage, keyword, constant etc) to simplify updating the colours in the theme.  

This theme could form a good base for other themes - just change the 5 base
colours and the background/text colours and the theme _should_ port to most
colour combinations.

It works well with PHP, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS/LESS.

El Picador is the opening track on Calexico's 2000 album, _Hot Rail_.
